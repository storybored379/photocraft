# MCP conventions

PhotoCraft follows the same conventions as FilmCraft #28. Start a headless session:

```sh
photocraft-cli mcp --automation-read-root /work/project --automation-write-root /work/project
```

Paths are relative to the corresponding root; without a root that filesystem authority is
absent. Bridge mode uses `--bridge` and `--control-token-file` as described in
[development.md](development.md). UI tools require a running desktop app.

## Tools and resources

- `command_list`: discover engine ids, parameter docs and current enabled state; accepts
  `filter` and `enabled_only`.
- `command_run`: `id`, optional `params` and `wait`. Command parameters remain engine-defined.
- `command_batch`: ordered `steps`, optional `stop_on_error`; one history step per command,
  not an atomic transaction. Existing per-step results and reply budgets are preserved.
- `doc_inspect`: layer tree, history and selection; an empty session returns `document:null`.
- `render_preview`: bounded PNG content; `index` and `max_side` (default 1024, maximum 2048).
- `ui_inspect` and `ui_screenshot`: live app state/window in bridge mode.

Existing document/session/job/UI tools remain listed, including the documented
`doc_render_preview` spelling. There are no hidden legacy aliases. Every tool has a title
and all four annotation hints. Generic command/control tools conservatively advertise writes;
file saves may replace existing targets. Hints do not grant permission.

Unknown tool arguments return JSON-RPC `-32602`, naming the key, before execution. Batch
step envelopes are strict too. Nested engine `params` retain their command-specific handling.
Tool execution failures return `isError:true`. A worker panic becomes a tool error and the
existing poisoned-session recovery keeps serving. Invalid JSON lines receive `-32700` with
`id:null`; the next line is still processed.

`photocraft://document` and `photocraft://commands` return live JSON matching `doc_inspect`
and `command_list`. Resource reads are uncached; tool/resource catalogs are private and cached
for ten minutes. List/read responses include the MCP 2026-07-28 result/cache fields.
